# location_saver_android_app
Save your favorite locations using this app. Users can pin locations on map and can view list of pinned location in a listView. This app helped me to learn about map activity and handling user location.


Download repository and extract zip file. Open project in Android Studio.

Put your GOOGLE MAPS API KEY in the /app/src/debug/values/google_maps_api.xml file to run the app succesfully.
